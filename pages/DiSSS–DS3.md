## DS3: **Deconstruction**:  
### It's too much, too large is a feeling––break the skill into smallest learnable units
#### He had fantastic hacks for deconstruction -- like finding a world class performer who lacked the "natural talent" and thus you could expect would have had to find the true "fundamentals", particularly one who was no longer in the spotlight, and then interview them

#### Or ask an expert for what a beginner needs to know, and an expert would need to focus on

## DS3: **Selection**:  
### Select the units that have the highest return
#### 1000 words make up like 80% of the writing in a language (focus on those, and the words that matter to the domain you care about)

## DS3: **Sequence**: 
### Identify the right order to learn the units
#### If you learn the 100 words that are most important for conversing and asking questions, you can get to a place where practice is both enjoyable, and something you can do all the time.

## DS3: **Stakes**: Make it matter generate self-discipline
### Have weekly goals and a certain 'punishment' for failing them. Like signing up for https://www.stickk.com/ and donating to something you don't like if you fail.

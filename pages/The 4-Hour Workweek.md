title: The 4-Hour Workweek

## Website link: [The 4-Hour Workweek](https://fourhourworkweek.com/) is a (2007) book by [[Tim Ferris]]
### One of the best and most [[ethical]] ideas of the work is the [[80/20 rule]]

### Less [[ethical]]ly clear but eminently sensible: outsourcing your more menial work, pay someone else to do it

## We can tell a lot about the audience (at least the editor aimed for) and (probable) mentality of [[Tim Ferris]] at this time of writing by the subtitle of the book: **Escape 9–5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich**

title: encryption

- I guess the below was written in Roam, but with Logseq do I want encryption or not?
    - It means I can't see my pages as plain text, and I will be locked into their chosen encryption method
    - Well they made a really cool program for encrypted or decrypting the whole graph!
        - So that means we can write here and save to GitHub as encrypted md and org, and then make a backup of notes in an unencrypted format.

title: 80/20 rule
---

## The [[economist]] [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) perceived [The Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) in 1896 when he noticed that 80% of Italian land was owned by 20% of the population.
### He saw this pattern was repeated in other countries too

## Business managers have used this principle to note (as [[Tim Ferris]] does in his book [[The 4-Hour Workweek]]) 80% of sales/income come from 20% of clients.
### The flip means 80% of work goes to 20% of sales/income

### I have no idea if this is true in [[dāna]], as I don't analyse it. Because that would not feel [[ethical]] or [[appropriate]]

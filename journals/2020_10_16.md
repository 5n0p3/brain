- [[Case ID 101084281505]]
    - "The issue under investigation wouldn't affect the other MacBook Air" (because nobody has complained about it).
        - “We’re aware of the keyboard… issue" (because other people have complained about it).
            - Since 2018!
                - And despite that being over 2 yrs ago you haven't managed to fix it!
                - Probably because it is hardware based, and yet doesn't show up on Apple's diagnostic methodology––which is a piece of software Apple engineers have written.
                    - **So you're trying to write a software fix for a hardware problem you don't know about, because your software can't find it.**
                        - Which is not reassuring.
                    - Yet you tell the customer to wait for you to do all of that.
                        - That is not reasonable. Their computer is depreciating all the while…
                        - What is reasonable is to replace Apple's mistake in making a non-functioning computer––this highly-priced piece of hardware is not living up to the advertised quality.
                            - I want a working computer now, not when Apple finds a way to write a piece of software that somewhat mitigates a mistake in the hardware they made.
    - Maybe this is time to make a complaint.
        - Which means writing to the Republic of Ireland!

- I think there is finally more potential in Logseq than in TW5 for what I wish to do
  - It will be just as simple to run Logseq in a separate program than it is to run TW5 through the terminal and in Safari
  - What I lose is the autocorrect of Safari, but what I gain is something that is a lot more smooth to write in and collect my thoughts through
  - The question eventually will be if I can use it through Safari with encryption and online sync
  - Wow, suddenly the spell checker started to work
    - So the autocorrect of commonly misspelled words is all I'm missing
- Copied this from the sidebar, but I've always really enjoyed Latex: $$E=mc^2$$

## Going to send a new meditation to [[Kiran]]
### Maybe use add silence to save time
#### But maybe it's better to utilise the felt sense and guide it straight
### Principles to cover:
#### [[vedanā]]
##### Not personal
##### Happens all the time
###### So happens on many levels at any time
####### Whatever we attend to
######## Sensations
######### Reactions to those sensations
########## Not perceived as well as perceived
#### [[fabrication]]
##### Both vedanā is fabricated and it fabricates…
###### We're going to guide a change in both…
##### [[bodily fabrication]]
###### Right posture
###### The form the space it appears in
##### [[verbal fabrication]]
###### This is vedanā
####### I can be with this enough to know it
####### I can enjoy challenges in other areas
######## Maybe here too
###### Tone of that noting
##### [[mental fabrication]]
###### What is a better term for [[mental fabrication]] maybe [[attentional fabrication]] will keep searching
###### Where attention lands
###### How attention lands
####### Not a fact an opinion

      doing:: 1618067317374
      waiting:: 1618051876703
        - So that’s cool
        - On Roam it’s hard to add something new
            - Because the toolbar doesn’t actually work at least not in Firefox mobile

    - This is not the main preferred way of doing stuff because it wasn't reliable in saving and storing stuff
    - Hopefully that has changed
- I actually came to write something important
    - But that will wait

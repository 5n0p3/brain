## I really don't feel like I know how to best use this
### I'm planning today to have an unproductive day

### I don't know what that will look like, but for one I hope I will be able to do some fun things
#### DONE [[skating]] around the block

#### TODO Play some music

#### DONE Watch the Wolf of Wall Street 
##### I did 30 mins not bad for a beginner

#### TODO [[Typing]] to music (is that fun?)

####

- I'm going to try this with [[org-mode]]
    - Only done a little reading on it, but it doesn't sound so hard
    - Maybe from there it will be worth even looking into [[org-roam]]
    - It's not possible to switch between modes without changing the settings to I'll stick to markdown for now
    - What I did discover though it is possible to run a spell checker on this doc in [[VS Code]] after the fact
        - And I've made a further indent in VS Code so that's cool

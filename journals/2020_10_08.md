## Call with Dwayne about [[Case ID 101084281505]]
### Quit Firefox to reduce the restart
#### As Sleep-wake failures are linked to a Firefox add-on

#### And is this related to keyboard-trackpad issue

### Engineers are saying it's software
#### TODO Need to extend the warranty

#### Normally agents don't offer a replacement while they're working on it

### My questions for the engineers?
#### The customer thinks this is hardware.

#### Are you aware of any hardware issues?
##### How would they show up?

##### This is the question he wants answered:
###### Can you prove it is not a hardware issue with the computer he bought?

#### I made a time machine back up and loaded it on a 2011 no issues.
#####

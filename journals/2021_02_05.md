## Going today for the second jab
## Feeling under the weather with an achey ear already since Wednesday night
### Actually it is affecting the whole right side from back of the mouth to down the neck, and up to the temple
### Not going to the doctors yet as it is not too bad, and not getting worse
### But it is affecting my hearing
### Currently wondering if it is tooth ache
#### Will go brush now
## On Sunday [[Feb 7th, 2021]] will go to the [[doctor]] anyway to intiate some tests

### Stool test
#### Had IBS for a long time
#### Full blood test
#### And anything else as I'm often distended in the night, have a quick stool, and generally not feeling quite right with my digestion
## Just discovered these [[evergreen notes]] by Stian: https://notes.reganmian.net/about?stackedPages=%2Fproject-fluid
### Should share this with [[Gerald]] as well as the fact that now Logseq is local as far as files are concerned
### [[TiddlyWiki]] still has one up on them for that, fully local operating. I love that.
#### That's why I want to find a way to make them all play together nicely
##### Will try to edit the js Roam import from Saq
##### And adapt Stian's exporter
## Some [[Logseq shortcomings]]
### When you add a line to a transcluded linked reference it doesn't add a bullet, so you can't indent

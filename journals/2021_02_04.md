## Need to find the motivation to learn Logseq and keep on working with it
### I'm pleased to notice that Brave has access to my keyboard extensions and auto-corrects like adding the longer ā accents to mettā etc.
### I could use this for meeting notes
### What I'll do next is import all my Roam notes into this and see how it handles itself
#### So there was some teething problems
##### For one it seems like all the imported child bullets don't know when they don't have children
##### The block references work but not quite right either
### In the long term I look forward to compiling Logseq on my local machine, along with my local notes
#### Things to explore at some point:
##### https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases/tag/0.0.6
###### Downloaded it [[Feb 5th, 2021]] and it's working nicely, no spell correction at all, but it auto completes words in my user dictionary

####### That's the more important bit

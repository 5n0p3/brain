- [[Case ID 101084281505]]
    - Engineers the issues:
        - Which one:
            - Keyboard and trackpad
        - Kernel panic occurred in recent shutdown
        - Didn't respond to my request for reassurance
    - Sending new email
        - Confirm keyboard trackpad 2 years
        - Shut downs
            - Devices connected
            - Up to 3 times a week
        - Does Apple know the issue
            - Not asking for inside info, but reassurance Apple is making progress
    - The point is for 3 months or more **I have only heard Apple has received reports and we're investigating**.
        - This is not reassuring!
        - So what is happening?
        - Why no signs of progress or a fix?
        - Is this likely to be so complex and subtle as to be interminable? Yes!
            - If so should it be the customer who waits, or Apple who gives a replacement?

                    - Time conscious rather than time focused
                    -
                    - “What when I do it…”
                        - Attention the precious resource that can bring into incredible freedom in the dharma
                            - Is the same thing we can spend on hours of YT and FB
                        - We can be intentional on the cushion but that’s a small part of our life
                            - What about the rest of the calendar day
                        - A part is me even doubts a Dharma teacher should talk about this topic
                            - But it’s important, and for some we may not know it, and if we don’t
                                - What we do with our precious time
                                - Time is empty and fabricated but also precious
                                - And many studies show we can do a lot out a little good or harm with it
                                    - If there is time there is dukkha
                                        - More about that next week
                                    - But there are degrees here and now with talking about
                                        - What have you done!
                            - Talk about commitment to this
                        - Appreciation for you showing up for the course
                            - And for life these weeks
                              aybe never in the history of humanity have beings had better conditions for making time for enjoying life
                    - More beings having longer lives, but also working more, and longer hours
                    - And between that we have all other kinds of demands on our [[attention]]
                    - Also some beings more lonely and disengaged from meaningfulness
                - Never nothing we can do
                    - Nothing I know in the Dharma suggests otherwise
                        - Fabricated implies we always fabricate when there is appearance
                - Let no one neglect their task for the sake of another's however great;
                  let them, after they have discerned their task, devote themselves to their task.
                   — Dhp 166 (Gender fixed)
                    - Let’s tidy that up:
                        -
                        - May none neglect their heart’s calling (and the tasks that come with that) 
                          Least of all for the reason of external pressures 
                          no matter however attractive or impressive they sound; 
                          let them, 
                          after they have discerned what is meaningful in their live 
                          devote themselves to their heart’s calling (and the tasks that come with that).
                            - Devoted to our tasks
                               But only after discernment

                                - And what by the end of the year
                                - This month

                            - Why do you appreciate it (because I love music)
                            - Why that (because it’s moving emotions)
                            - Why that…(because it’s freeing)
                            - So you want to be or feel free? And your S mystic
                                - Yes

                    - Make a list (see Add to Week Three note)
                        - When we make decisions are we feeling time rich or time poor?
                            - It is easy to measure money: wealth; assets; salary

                                - The main focus on a job or our lifetime should be how much time for what I discern as meaningful
                                - Whether rich or poor we have something to do
                        - Do we value time or money more?
                            - Fund time to find time
                                - Researching to save pennies
                        - Do we value the present or the future more?
                        - What do you think leads to more happiness?
                    - We're dealing with future time and past tome this week
                        - Take a random Tuesday and review it  (not why I’m running this on a Tuesday)
                        - Divide morning, afternoon, evening
                        - Am I doing what is valuable to me?
                            - When were not that is stressful and time feels limited
                            - Wasting time implies needing more time to do what I feel called to do with my time
                        - Then I’m too tired and rather than rest I fill time then sleep badly or not enough
                            - Have a bad day, feel tired…
                    - Get rid of social media
                        - Of reduce it to the intentional
                            - We can be like a person going up stairs and forgetting why we went online
                                - Purposeful with our sense of purpose
                                    - Go to bed at a fixed time
                                        - Meditate at night (that third meditation has many purposes)
                                    - Standing around meditation
                                        - Browsing around meditation not quite the same (We covered this I think)
                                          What happened and how was it:
                                        - categorise why we did it
                                            - meaningful,
                                            - pleasure,
                                            - someone else's task/reason
                                        - And how it was
                                            - stressful or easeful,
                                            - mindfulness or mindlessness
                                    - We need pleasures as well as meaning
                                        - So don’t neglect it reject them
                                    - But we mostly want happiness from meaningfulness
                                        - Lasts longer affects deeper (what when I do it…)
                                    - Like hospice work, child care, yoga as care for body,
                                        - These can be pleasant in themselves
                                        - But they’re more of a stretch, a challenge, a growth, an edge
-
    - Distractions and Tractions
        - How to relate to stress so we get back our life time?
            - Notice the vedanā
                - And not react (add more reactivity to reactivity)
                    - Enough already
                        - Like last week
                - The habitual response is dukkha
            - Notice the hindrance: forms of dukkha (order of ‘noticing and response’ between hindrance and vedanā etc. can change order)
                - Apply the antidote swiftly
                    - Pāramīs and Awakening factors
                        - Notion template so encourage engagement
                            - Had what hindrance
                                - Did what antidote
                        - Let me know if you want it
                - Not personal
                - Not to be believed
                    - Kind non identification
                - Don't do nothing
            - Hindrances take time
                - Antidotes make time
                - Make time for generosity, renunciation, mettā
                    - Good values to aim towards
                - And they’ll make time for you
        - The paradox of rules and freedom
            - Gokarna train station
            - Rules of being vegetarian
                - We make an effort to break them
                - Habits are unconscious and need to be made conscious
                - Eat healthy is a habit
                    - It’s relaxed
                - I don’t eat dessert is a rule
                    - Is someone going to convince you just this one time
                    - Then it’s not a rule
                - Breaking a rule must feel final
                    - Dharma as law like in physics
                        - Rules as local laws
                            - For freedom, generosity, discipline, dedication, devotion
                        - Rules to keep to the timetables of our intentions: for tasks and free time
                            - Make appointments we can’t get out of
                                - Like leisure time, free time, meditation time: you can’t cancel on them.
                                    - How can you going to let them know?
                        - There is a place for converting things into meditations
                            - But there is also time for doing nothing
                                - The purpose of art is to be something without a purpose
                                    - A transcendent activity outside of the normal reward systems
                                    - In this meditation is an art
                                        - Something we change our time for, make our time for, and it in turn opens the time we have
                                            - Inception
-
    - We can be over focussed on now (have a good week or moment!)
        - Shavua tov on a walk
            - What’s a good time frame to wish well?
                - Good day, years, life
                    - It can’t be fixed if it’s to be appropriate to a dynamic changing world
                        - Markets daily or quarterly
                            - We want to respond to patterns of improvement in practice and like
                                - Judging the prestige of the practice not the practitioner
                                    - What is happening
                                        - What do I wish to be happening
                                            - What shall I do
                                                - It’s all fabricated
                                                              ion
                                                              eel final
- Three time frames for reflection
-
    - Meditate in presence
        - Heart of now, apply insights, get to know and shape well
            - Or the Dharma GTD
                - Intend (intentions) = values (meaningfulness)
                    - Incline = wholesome
                        - Decline =
                            - Journal on recent memorable past
                                - Did or didn't do something
                                    - How it was
                                        - Hindrances and antidotes
                                            - Other circumstances
                                                   memorable past

                                                    - When we plan
                                                        - The important
                                                        - The urgent
                                                        - The meaningful
                                                    - It’s optional to go here, and the place I’m talking about might feel extreme
                                                        - Boring
                                                        - Not free
                                                            - But try it and see for yourself
                                                                - Start as a moderate, schedule a few things
                                                                - Then go towards the extreme

## I had an [[insight]] 
### It arose while [[skating]] I was doing a mohawk, and it actually worked for once.
#### That is partly because I really strapped my boots on amazingly well today.

#### But significantly it worked because I got low, went at a good pace, and committed to it.

### So this is an [[insight]] into risk and reward, confidence and success co-arise.
#### Meaning when you bring the qualities of confidence you become more likely to succeed. 
##### In the mohawk example above, if I were to fail at that moment I was a bit more vulnerable––moving at speed, yet I was lower to the ground so falling wouldn't have been from so high, yet I didn't have as much freedom to adjust my balance (I imagine).

#### Yet having the confidence to take the risk meant that I could pull off the trick because it allowed me to trust in myself to succeed.
##### So I feel this is the heart of the [[insight]] we need to be good enough to try with commitment, you can't fake it too early and make it work––there is a skill that supports taking the risk, and that lowers the risk in the risk.

##### Like entering a [[jhāna]] once you've gotten close, you can dive in. Once you've dived in you can keep diving in. It get easier to do as you become more confident you can do it. Soon you're a master.

## I feel this would be better to proceed with at least until the refactoring project is done
### This is not encrypted, but [[encryption]] is not needed for most of what I'm doing
### I mean let's just see how well we can get on with a non-encrypted version with sync and things
#### If it's not this that's problematic then we'll soon know as it seems to crash quite swiftly with a mobile sync
#### TODO Give it a few days I say [[Apr 28th, 2021]]

## I need to write to [[Apple]] about my [[MacBook Air 2018]] concerning [[Case ID 101084281505]]
### Today I got the voice recordings and case notes from privacy_response@apple.com #[[Case ID 101084281505]] generated on [[October 1st, 2020]]

## I liked this from Anne-Laure Le Cunff:
### https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app

### "…there are three main note-taking styles:
#### The architect. They enjoy planning, designing processes and frameworks, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily structure their ideas.

#### The gardener. They enjoy exploring, connecting various thoughts together, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily grow their ideas.

#### The librarian. They enjoy collecting, building a catalogue of resources, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily retrieve their ideas."

## I'm declaring myself an architect, and made myself a daily log in notion 2 weeks ago. But I'm thinking the side of me that enjoys learning can get a lot from being on Roam. As soon as Logseq is ready I'll probably transfer over there.

## Just this moment I realise what's happened: I encrypted all my memories and lost the (decryption) key. I can```javascript
``` sort of see the trace of them, but they're all jumbled up, and look like an almost imperceptible cloud of random noise.

- Working to release the [[back]]
    - Been finding that it's not (just) that my [[spine]] is misaligned, it's a large bulk of muscle that is on the right mid-back that I feel when I roll on the back (in a fetus) position.
        - So I have been using some of my [[massage]] tools to dig into that area and really release this zone
            - Using a variety of the knobs on the purple thingy when sitting up. Starting with a narrow knob, then moving on to one of the larger ones.
                - Or rubbing up and down the sides of the spine.
            - Or leaning in to the stuck area with the black spherical eight when I'm lying on my back.

- Some notes from [[one to one meeting]] on the [[Lingering in Happiness]] [[retreat]]
  - With Efrat
    heading:: true
    - In some kind of struggle
      - Usually mettā and compassion practice, and finding pleasant sensations in the body is accessible and works well
    - Hard to put aside the struggle
    - Separation between the 'team'
    - Hearts wish to open, mind has fear, and body reacting to this
      - **Breathing not helping?**
    - In the talk sounds so accessible
      - But body, heart, mind feel separate
      - Pain in chest
      - Suffocation in throat
        - Hard to breathe
      - Shaking body is helpful
        - **Like body is stuck, tight, rigid**
  - With Yifat
    heading:: true
    - Playing the same notion of tuning into what is love, delightful,
      - And not towards the negative, away from the craziness
    - There is suffering, pain, and craziness
      - By putting attention on my well-being
    - Easy and quick to go to the good
    - Available for those near to me
    - If you read the news make it a three part meditation
      - Like bringing empathy or appreciation to those we don't like so much
        - [[Edward Conze]]'s point that appreciation is the root of all [[brahmavihārās]]
  - With Noam
- Day 1 of [[health]] updates during a dosing of [[antibiotics]] for potential lower intestinal infection
  - Taking Ciprox TZ for 10 days
  - Dropping coffee for the duration, and multi vitamins for same but also started that yesterday. Also increasing carbohydrates to absorb the chemicals.
    - All an attempt to reduce acidity
    - Shame about the coffee as I think [[James Hoffman]]'s recipe for the [[aeropress]] is a winner.

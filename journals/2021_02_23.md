## I wonder if apart from spell correction and can't add new blocks in references[[Logseq]] is ready for daily use
### It certainly types faster than [[RR-TW5]] and the keyboard shortcuts make for a smoother work flow
#### Up and down arrows to directly edit a text
#### Undo is useful if a little wild––deletes a whole line of text, not just what I copied in
##### And redo also isn't consistent. It is cmd-y and does work sometimes
#### Cmd-shift arrows is good for up and down
#### Cmd-up/down to expand collapse the text is great
#### Some concern about saving, but it is all local now
### Noticed some new bugs [[Logseq shortcomings]]
#### Clicking a link from the unlinked references, continues to show the unlinked references from the page I just left
#### Also editing the order of linked references (tested in sidebar)affects the order on the original (on the main page) but not in the linked reference
##### I wonder if this is to allow the updates to go more slowly
##### Sometimes it works
## I wonder about looking at [[Obsidian]] again
### As the electron apps do now accept by keyboard shortcuts and expansions
## Just had a really delightful [[standing]] [[meditation]]
### Did 15 mins then added another 5 as it felt so enjoyable to just stand
### Been a while since I felt so much enjoyment in the posture, or any meditation posture that requires effort
#### I wonder why it was like that. But also simply very nice in and of itself.
## Need to give some attention to the [[Making Time for Life]] [[online course]]
### It's not easy for me to be in two spaces
#### Ramping up for the [[Lingering in Happiness]] [[retreat]]
##### So all the ideas around how to attune to joy, happiness, well-being
##### Appreciation, muditā, connection (sympathy, harmony, care)
#### And then attuning to slowing down time
##### Not pulling in opposite directions, but also complex in their own way, and needing to be precise and clear in each
### So it goes, and back to it
#### I need a coffee but the cleaner is in the kitchen.
#### Would love a walk, but it's cold and overcast

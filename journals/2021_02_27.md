- Day 3 of [[health]] update on [[antibiotics]]
    - Very loose stool like a whippy ice cream
    - Another gassy, bloated, and agitated (restless from 5am) night
        - More burps than before
    - Although I wonder if under chewed food is a major part of my issues
        - LATER work out how to be mindful when eating
          now:: 1614430851498
          later:: 1614430867332
    - Starting yesterday evening to be feeling more acidity and chemically in the mouth
        - Particularly back of mouth and tongue
- I can see that the future for [[note-taking]] is in [[Logseq]] for me
  canceled:: 1614411406439
    - But the future is not ever coming
    - What is the present [[note-taking]] solution
        - I would say it's probably Roam by stability and work flow
            - I can use it in Safari with all the spell checking and speed I desire
            - But it is slow to load
            - And I don't have easy access to my data
                - Can't decide where it is stored
                - Can't make it secure
                - Can't have it offline
        - So maybe [[TW5]] but to make it block specific ([[¿question?]] do I need that) it need to be something that runs slow over time
            - It simply wasn't made for having so many tiddlers being created and interlinking with unlinked references
                - It seems that [[Clojure]] is more able to do that
            - And moving between the blocks is more clumsy
                - Can't double press enter to reduce a line, without also loosing the ability to close the editor with that instruction
                    - Actually that's the same here in Logseq! I can add empty nodes…
                    - Not quite the same the same, as I go back by pressing enter I grab the block beneath the currently line being decreasingly indented, and take it with it, and presumably all the one's below that
        - [[Logseq]] is fast to load and has shown no slowness in creation
            - The negatives being no spell checker and autocorrect of my poor typing
            - Safari and GitHub don't work well
            - Can't edit linked references with new child or sibling bullets
- Here we have the latest release working now
    - Not sure what that was still no spellchecker of course but what do you expect

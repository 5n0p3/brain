## [[Case ID 101084281505]]
### Could be something else
#### IPD flex cable

### We haven't been researching this for two years
#### The issue would not have been around for so long
##### Sounds like that know about this quite well

##### **So how long is an issue going to remain**

#### But it's been around for a while

### I now have internet drop outs

### Firefox plugin, Audacity app, Brackets helper, 

### Only kernel panic in the logs

### Late Sept/Oct new apps were installed

### If issues remain on test volume should be hardware
#### And should do the IPD flex cable fix

#### Was this done before?

### Dwayne: ask the repair people should this normally be done, or ring a store that does fixes.
#### Nathan: try to contact DCS and find out if they replace the IPD cable 

### Software process taking too long to respond to the wake
####

## A hard graft day
### Creating mail outs, sign up forms, and dharma talks
#### What can I say there is a very good feeling in me about all of this [[creative writing]]
##### And I don't want to blow my own trumpet because I don't have one
###### But I'm pretty good at [[writing]] and composing an email
####### It sounds fun, and inviting, and that should support all the projects we offer
## Had a real 'mare getting code to work with [[Moosend]]
### Just couldn't get it to work
#### They anticipated that we would allow them (not entirely unfettered) access to our domain, and thence track people who came to our site
##### Nope
##### And the methodology for working as a third party site to ourselves didn't work
#### [[Mailchimp]] on the other hand allowed a lot more options for just having the code for adding my own styles
##### Or in this specific case not adding any styles

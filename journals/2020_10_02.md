- So I can't use this for my [[one to one meeting]] as it isn't private enough yet.
  - I don't think it honours my students if I write about our meetings here.
  - Maybe if I use pseudonyms it would be okay.
    - But do I want to do that?
      - No I wouldn't but what if I encrypted them?
      - Then how would I find them again?
      - Would initials be enough? Yes, it would.
- If it's not for work then what does it do for me?
- It could be for [[teachings]]â€¦but would I use it like that.
  - The good thing is it is quite easy to import stuff into, and the transclusion is really nice
